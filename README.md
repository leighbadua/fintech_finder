# fintech_finder
A prototype application that allows its customers to find fintech professionals, hire them, and pay them.

This project integrates two files that will generate a digital wallet, access Ethereum account balances, and sign and send transactions via a personal Ethereum blockchain called Ganache. A breakdown of the project code that will do the following:
* Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.
* Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.
* Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.
* Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.
* Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.


## Technologies

This project uses the following libraries and dependencies:
+ [**Anaconda**](https://docs.anaconda.com/): an open source package and environment management system.
+ [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): is a programming language that offers a vast modules and libraries such as dataclass, typing, hashlib, datetime, and much more.
+ [**requests**](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install): HTTP library for Python. 
+ [**web3**](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#installation): a Python library for interacting with Ethereum. Help with sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, reading block data, and a variety of other use cases.
+ [**eth-tester**](https://pypi.org/project/ethereum-tester/0.1.0a4/): a Python library that provides access to the tools weâ€™ll use to test Ethereum-based applications.
+ [**mnemonic**](https://pypi.org/project/mnemonic/): a Python implementation for generating a 12- or 24-word mnemonic seed phrase based on the BIP-39 standard.
+ [**bip44**](https://pypi.org/project/bip44/): a Python implementation for deriving hierarchical deterministic wallets from a seed phrase based on the BIP-44 standard.
+ [**Ganache**](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/): a personal blockchain for repid Ethereum and Corda distributed application development. Used in development cycle. 
+ [**Streamlit**](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started): a Python library that works only with Python files (.py files). It quickly turns Python scripts into shareable web apps. For this application we will create a user-friendly webpage interface for a blockchain.
